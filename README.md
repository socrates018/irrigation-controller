# irrigation-controller

I made this circuit to actuate a latching solenoid using a simple timed pulse. My goal is to have an easy way to control a solenoid with a digital input, like from an ESP32 or another microcontroller, so I can use it as part of a bigger project (for example, automating irrigation).
